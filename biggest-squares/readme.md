#Biggest Squares

Francis has a thing for perfectly-square areas of land. Given the square footage of a property, return a list of the areas of the square sections of property.

For example, for 9 square feet, there's only one square - a perfect 3x3 - so the function should return 9. For 12 square feet, there's a 3x3 (9, 3 square feet left), and three 1x1's (the remaining 3 square feet) - it should return [9, 1, 1, 1].
